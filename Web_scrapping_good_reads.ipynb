    "\n",
    "In the earlier ages, ratings for non-English books are more varied, ranging from 2.5 to 5.\n",

    "but these books received more diverse feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lowest Ratings at Later Ages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to the English-only analysis, the lowest average ratings for non-English books occur at later ages.\n",
    "This may reflect differences in audience preferences or the author's experimentation with \n",
    "different genres or styles in non-English markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant Relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the English-only analysis, the overall trend is constant, with average ratings \n",
    "generally fluctuating between 3 to 5 across all ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congestion at Later Ages:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the later ages, the line plot becomes more congested, indicating that the \n",
    "author wrote more non-English books during this time.\n",
    "This could reflect a shift in focus or a broader audience appeal in non-English markets \n",
    "during the later stages of their career.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent High Ratings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the spread at earlier ages and congestion at later ages, the ratings tend to remain high, \n",
    "showcasing the author's ability to maintain quality across languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "Including books in languages other than English reveals greater variability in ratings at early ages, \n",
    "with lowest ratings occurring later. \n",
    "The relationship remains largely constant, with fluctuations within a 3 to 5 range, \n",
    "but the line plot suggests an increase in the author's productivity in non-English markets later in life. \n",
    "While the patterns differ slightly, the overall interpretation of a stable relationship between age and ratings persists.\n",
