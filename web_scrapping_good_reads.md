### **Task**: Scrape data from Goodreads.com üìö

---

### **Objective**
For this exam, you will scrape and analyze data from Goodreads.com. The work is split into two parts, each focusing on different aspects of the data
1. **"Best Books" Analysis**: Explore Goodreads' "Best Books" lists for a specific year.
2. **Author-Level Analysis**: Study the trends and patterns in the works of a specific author.

---

### **Instructions**

#### **Task 1: Best Books**
You are tasked with analyzing Goodreads' "Best Books" lists for a specific year based on the **first letter of your first name**. For example, if your first name starts with **A‚ÄìE**, you are assigned to the year **2023**; if it starts with **F‚ÄìJ**, you are assigned to **2022**, and so on:

| Initials | Assigned Year | URL                                              |
|----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| A‚ÄìE      | 2023          | [Best Books of 2023](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2023) |
| F‚ÄìJ      | 2022          | [Best Books of 2022](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2022) |
| K‚ÄìO      | 2021          | [Best Books of 2021](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2021) |
| P‚ÄìT      | 2020          | [Best Books of 2020](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2020) |
| U‚ÄìZ      | 2019          | [Best Books of 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2019) |



**Your Tasks**:
1. Scrape data from the Goodreads "Best Books of [Year]" list:
   - **URL**: https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2023 (replace the year with your assigned year). You can also use the table above.
2. Collect the following data for each book:
   - Title
   - Publication date (first published)
   - Author
   - Genre (if available, and feel free to pick the first genre listed)
   - Average rating
   - Number of ratings
   - Number of pages
   - Rank
   - Language (if available)
   - Number of people who are currently reading (if available)
   - Number of people who want to read (if available)
3. Perform the following analyses:
   - **Genre ratings**:
       - Compare average ratings across genres. Which 2-3 genres tends to have the highest ratings? Create a table showing average rating score, and average rank by genre.
   - **Popularity and ratings**:
       - Examine whether books with more ratings tend to have higher or lower average scores. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between the number of ratings and average rating. On the x-axis, you should have **number of ratings**; on the y-axis, you should have **average rating**.

---

#### **Task 2: Author-Level Analysis**
You are now tasked with analyzing books by a specific author based on the **first letter of your first name**:

| Your first name initial | Author              | Author Goodreads link                               | Birthday       |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| A‚ÄìE      | Stephen King        | [Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/3389)         | Sep 21, 1947   |
| F‚ÄìJ      | George R.R. Martin  | [George R.R. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/346732) | Sep 20, 1948   |
| K‚ÄìO      | Ernest Hemingway    | [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/1455)     | Jul 21, 1899   |
| P‚ÄìT      | Neil Gaiman         | [Neil Gaiman](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/1221698)       | Nov 10, 1960   |
| U‚ÄìZ      | Nora Roberts        | [Nora Roberts](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/625)          | Oct 10, 1950   |


**Your Tasks**:
1. Scrape all books by your assigned author:
   - Use the link provided for your author.
2. Collect the following data for each book:
   - Title
   - Publication date (first published)
   - Author
   - Genre (if available, and feel free to pick the first genre listed)
   - Average rating
   - Number of ratings
   - Number of pages
   - Rank (from the books written by the author)
   - Language (if available)
   - Number of people who are currently reading (if available)
   - Number of people who want to read (if available)
3. Perform the following analyses:
   - **Language Distribution**:
     - How many books has the author published in English? In other languages? Create a table showing the count of books by language.
   - **Author's Age and Page Count**:
     - Do authors tend to write longer books as they age? Use the author's birthday to calculate their age at the time of each book's publication. Create a line plot with **author's age** on the x-axis and **page count** on the y-axis.
   - **Author's Age and Rating**:
     - For English-only books, create a line plot with **author's age** on the x-axis and **average rating** on the y-axis.
     - Repeat the analysis including books in languages other than English. Does your interpretation change?
   - **Pages vs. Ratings**:
     - Is there a relationship between the number of pages and a book's average rating? Create a scatterplot with **page count** on the x-axis and **average rating** on the y-axis.
   - **Interest on a book**:
     - Is there a relationship between the number of people who are currently reading the book and the number of people who left a rating? Create a scatterplot with **number of people who are currently reading** on the x-axis and **number of ratings** on the y-axis. Create a second scatterplot with **average rating** on the y-axis. Do books with more interest tend to receive higher ratings?

---

### **Submission Requirements**
Submit your work as a single `.ipynb` file, along with a copy of it as a `.md` file. The notebook should include:
1. **Code**:
   - Well-documented python code using Selenium for web scraping.
   - Proper error handling and strategies for dynamic content.
2. **Cleaned Data**:
   - Include the cleaned datasets from both tasks as .csv files. You can upload them in your github repo.
3. **Analysis and Report**:
   - Present your findings using markdown cells, tables, and visualizations you make in python.
   - Address all questions posed for your assigned tasks.
4. **Visualizations**:
   - Include relevant charts (e.g., bar charts, line plots, scatterplots) to support your conclusions.

### **Rubric**

| Item                        | Weight |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Code accuracy               | 25%    |
| Code clarity and annotation | 25%    |
| Exploratory data analysis   | 25%    |
| Discussion of findings      | 25%    |

---

### **Tips**
- Make sure to insert time.sleep() right after you request driver to go to a link (before requesting elements). Make sure to wait at least 0.7 second, or even slightly higher if you run into issues.
- Try-except blocks will be your friend because xpath positions on a page may differ depending on the book and content availability.

# Average Rating Vs Number of Ratings

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Ensure columns are numeric
df['Number of Ratings'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Number of Ratings'], errors='coerce')
df['Average Rating'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Average Rating'], errors='coerce')

# Drop rows with missing or invalid data
df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=['Number of Ratings', 'Average Rating'])

# Scatterplot: Number of Ratings vs Average Rating
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df_cleaned['Number of Ratings'] / 1000, df_cleaned['Average Rating'], alpha=0.6, color='blue')  # Scale x-axis to thousands

# Set x-axis limits and ticks
plt.xticks(range(0, 1001, 100))  # Tick marks from 0 to 250 with intervals of 50
plt.xlim(0, 1000)  # X-axis range from 0 to 250

# Popularity and ratings:
# Examine whether books with more ratings tend to have higher or lower average scores. 
# Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between the number of ratings and average rating. 
# On the x-axis, you should have number of ratings; on the y-axis, you should have average rating.

'''
Initial Trend (Crowded Data Points):

When the scatterplot is congested in the lower range of the x-axis (fewer ratings), there appears to be a negative relationship.
As the number of ratings increases, the average rating tends to decrease. 
This suggests that highly-rated books may initially attract fewer ratings, potentially from niche or loyal audiences.

Mid-Range Stability:

As the number of ratings increases further, the average rating begins to stabilize around 4.0.
The relationship appears almost linear, with less variation in average ratings despite a wider range of rating counts.
Overall Trend:

Books with fewer ratings tend to have higher average scores, possibly due to a smaller and more targeted audience. 
Conversely, as more people rate the book, the scores tend to converge, possibly reflecting a broader and more diverse audience.
Key Insight:

While the initial part of the graph shows a decline in average ratings as popularity (ratings count) grows, 
the ratings become more consistent at a slightly lower level (~4.0) as the number of ratings increases.
This pattern highlights the potential influence of audience size and diversity on ratings. 
Books with limited reach may maintain higher average ratings, but as they gain popularity and attract a wider audience, 
the scores tend to level off, reflecting more balanced opinions.

Author's Age and Page Count: Observations

General Trend:

The line graph shows that page counts remain relatively similar across most age ranges.
There is no drastic fluctuation in the number of pages for books written at different ages.
Positive Relationship:

A slight positive correlation is observed as the author's age increases.
While most books have a consistent page count, longer books tend to appear at older ages.
Consistency in Page Counts:

Across the majority of the graph, the page counts are clustered within a stable range, 
indicating that the author's output in terms of book length does not vary significantly.
High Page Counts at Older Ages:

The highest page counts are observed later in the author's life, 
suggesting a possible trend of taking on larger projects with experience or 
a preference for writing more detailed works at older ages.

Key Insight:
While the overall relationship between author's age and page count is not strongly positive, 
the appearance of longer books later in life suggests a slight trend. 
This could be influenced by the author's growing expertise, confidence, 
or the ability to undertake more ambitious projects as they age.

Pages vs. Ratings: Observations
Initial Cluster:

In the initial cluster, the average ratings remain fairly consistent for books with fewer pages.
Low page counts correspond to both high and moderate average ratings.
Lower Ratings for Shorter Books:

Books with lower ratings are predominantly found in the low page count range.
This suggests that shorter books may face more critical reviews or appeal to a smaller audience.
Higher Ratings with Longer Books:

As the number of pages increases, there is a visible trend of higher average ratings.
Longer books tend to have more favorable reviews, possibly due to their depth and comprehensive storytelling.
Outliers with High Page Counts:



The best-fit line drawn on the scatterplot shows a positive slope, 
indicating a positive correlation between page count and average rating.
This trend reinforces the idea that longer books generally receive better ratings, 
though the relationship is not strongly linear.

Key Insight:
The scatterplot suggests a moderate positive relationship between the number of pages and average ratings. 
While shorter books are more likely to receive lower ratings, 
longer books generally fare better, with exceptions for a few outliers. 
The positive gradient of the best-fit line highlights this trend.

'''
Author's Age and Rating (English Books Only): 

Constant Relationship:

The average rating appears relatively constant across the author's ages.
Ratings fluctuate within a range of 3 to 5, 
with no strong increasing or decreasing trend as age progresses.

Lowest Ratings at Early Age:

Some of the lowest average ratings are observed when the author was younger.
This could indicate that earlier works received more critical feedback or had a smaller audience or 
the author had less experience at that time.

Fluctuations but Stable Overall:

While there are small fluctuations in ratings across the ages, the changes are not significant.
The general trend suggests that the author's work consistently 
maintains a high standard of reception over time.

No Strong Positive or Negative Trend:

Unlike other metrics like page count, author's age does not strongly influence ratings.
This highlights the consistency of the author's skill and audience reception throughout their career.

Key Insight:
The line plot shows that author age has little to no impact on average ratings for English books. 
While the lowest ratings are found at earlier ages, the overall trend remains stable, 
indicating the author's ability to maintain consistent quality and appeal across their career.

'''
Author's Age and Rating (Books in Languages Other Than English): 

Spread Out Ratings at Early Ages:

In the earlier ages, ratings for non-English books are more varied, ranging from 2.5 to 5.
This suggests that the author wrote fewer non-English books during their younger years, 
but these books received more diverse feedback.

Lowest Ratings at Later Ages:

Contrary to the English-only analysis, the lowest average ratings for non-English books occur at later ages.
This may reflect differences in audience preferences or the author's experimentation with 
different genres or styles in non-English markets.

Constant Relationship:

Similar to the English-only analysis, the overall trend is constant, with average ratings 
generally fluctuating between 3 to 5 across all ages.

Congestion at Later Ages:

In the later ages, the line plot becomes more congested, indicating that the 
author wrote more non-English books during this time.
This could reflect a shift in focus or a broader audience appeal in non-English markets 
during the later stages of their career.

Consistent High Ratings:

Despite the spread at earlier ages and congestion at later ages, the ratings tend to remain high, 
showcasing the author's ability to maintain quality across languages.

Key Insight:

Including books in languages other than English reveals greater variability in ratings at early ages, 
with lowest ratings occurring later. 
The relationship remains largely constant, with fluctuations within a 3 to 5 range, 
but the line plot suggests an increase in the author's productivity in non-English markets later in life. 
While the patterns differ slightly, the overall interpretation of a stable relationship between age and ratings persists.

Interest on a Book: Relationship Between Currently Reading and Number of Ratings

Initial Trend:

When the number of people currently reading is low, the number of ratings is also low.
This suggests a correlation between the immediate interest in a book and its historical popularity 
(as reflected by the number of ratings).

As Interest Grows:

As the number of people currently reading increases, the number of ratings also increases.
This positive trend indicates that books garnering higher interest 
also tend to have accumulated more ratings over time.

Clustering:

There is some clustering near lower values of "Currently Reading," where 
most books seem to have similar levels of interest and ratings.
At higher values of "Currently Reading," the spread of ratings becomes more diverse,
but the overall trend remains positive.

Key Relationship:

There is a positive relationship between the number of people currently reading a book and 
the total number of ratings the book has received.
This suggests that books with higher current interest tend to be more popular or widely read historically.

Insights:
Books with low current interest generally have fewer ratings,
while books with high current interest tend to have more ratings, 
indicating a consistent relationship between interest and popularity.
The scatterplot visually supports this trend, showing a positive correlation between the two variables.

'''
Interest on a Book: Relationship Between Currently Reading and Average Rating

No Clear Positive Trend:

As the number of people currently reading increases, 
the average rating does not show a significant increase or decrease.
The average rating remains fairly constant, fluctuating slightly but staying within a narrow range.

Rating Stability:

Books with both low and high current interest have ratings distributed across the same range, 
indicating that current interest does not necessarily correlate with higher ratings.

Clustering:

There is clustering of ratings between 3.5 and 4.5 for books with varying levels of current interest, 
suggesting that most books fall within this rating range regardless of the number of people currently reading.

Key Relationship:

There is no significant relationship between the number of people currently reading a book and its average rating.
Books with high interest do not tend to have notably higher ratings than those with lower interest.

Insights:
The analysis suggests that current interest in a book does not affect its average rating, 
as ratings remain consistent across different levels of interest. 
This indicates that factors influencing average ratings are likely independent of current readership trends.
